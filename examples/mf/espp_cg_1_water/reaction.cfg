# Allows to form a bond between active sites of the same residue.
# Keep in mind that when two monomers are connected then the residue id
# will be transfered and both will have the same.
# In principle, when the cutoff distance is small enough so that two
# active sites on the same monomer does not see each other then this
# should be enabled (1).
